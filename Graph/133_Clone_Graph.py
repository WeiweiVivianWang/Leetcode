#Time Complexity : O(N + M), where N is a number of nodes (vertices) and M is a number of edges.

# Space Complexity : O(N). This space is occupied by the visited dictionary and in addition to that, space would also be occupied by the queue since we are adopting the BFS approach here. 
#The space occupied by the queue would be equal to O(W)O(W) where WW is the width of the graph. Overall, the space complexity would be O(N)O(N).
